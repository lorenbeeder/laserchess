They included detailed gameplay instructions, and source code for several popular computers at the time. I didn't have any of those, so I wrote my own implementation for PC. This was my final project in my 10th grade AP Computer Science class in 1990. I got an A.

It runs fine in DOSBox. Just copy all these files into a folder, and run LCHESS.EXE. The screen scaling may be a little off on modern PCs since it runs in 640x350 EGA graphics mode.
